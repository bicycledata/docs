# TrafficLogger

We developed a portable, modular data logger with the primary purpose of logging various variables for overtaking and oncoming vehicles on rural roads. The ambition is to keep the equipment flexible, such that it can also be deployed in other environments and with other purposes.

## Mount

Currently the equipment is mounted on a rack that is attached to the seat post and seat rails to fit most bikes. It can also be modified to fit other so-called micromobility devices such as e-scooters. The equipment together with the rack weighs slightly over 1 kg and will in its final shape not be very conspicuous.
